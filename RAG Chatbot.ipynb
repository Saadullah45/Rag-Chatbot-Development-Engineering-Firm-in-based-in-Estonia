packages: langdetect, pypika\n\u001b[33m  DEPRECATION: Building 'langdetect' using the legacy setup.py bdist_wheel mechanism, which will be removed in a future version. pip 25.3 will enforce this behaviour change. A possible replacement is to use the standardized build interface by setting the `--use-pep517` option, (possibly combined with `--no-build-isolation`), or adding a `pyproject.toml` file to the source tree of 'langdetect'.

Today s NP battery sealed construction, efficient performance and long is the culmination of over 75 years of battery service life combine to make Yuasa NP batteries the most manufacturing experience. reliable and versatile valve regulated lead acid batteries available. ADVANCEMENTS With the progress of modern technology and the specific watts per kilo than conventional NP models when operated development of application requirements, Yuasa has at the 10 minute discharge rate. designed generic NP s to be application specific with the introduction of NPC, NPH and NPL product ranges. NPLOffers up to double the float service life of the conven- tional NP type battery. Note, these models are available to NPCis specifically designed to suit the arduous require- BS6290pt4 (1997). ments of cyclic applications allowing increased cycle life (at least double the cyclic life of conventional types). The generic types utilise identical physical designs and characteristics to the standard NP type in all aspects except NPH These high performance batteries are specifically their specific application advancement. This in many cases designed for applications requiring high rate discharge and allows users to upgrade without major redesign. offer much improved power densities up to 50% more TECHNICAL FEATURES Sealed Construction . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Yuasa s unique construction and sealing technique ensures that no electrolyte leakage should occur from the terminals or case of any NP battery. This feature provides for safe and effective operation of NP batteries in any orientation. Yuasa NP batteries are classified as Non-Spillable and meet all requirements of the International Air Transport Association. (I.A.T.A. Dangerous Goods Regulations), to allow transportation by air. Electrolyte Suspension System All Yuasa NP batteries utilise an electrolyte suspension system consisting of a glass fibre separator material. This suspension system helps to achieve maximum service life, by fully retaining the electrolyte and preventing its escape from the separator material. No silica gels or other contaminents are used. Gas Generation . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . NP batteries incorporate a unique Yuasa design that effectively recombines over 99% of the gas generated during normal usage. LowMaintenance Operation . . . . . . . During the life of NP batteries, there is no need to check their specific gravity or add water etc. In fact, there are no provisions for such maintenance functions to be carried out. Operation In Any Orientation . . . . . . The combination of\ncheck specific gravity of the electrolyte or add water to NP batteries during float service life. In fact, there is no provision for this type of maintenance. Low Pressure Valve Regulated System.. All NP batteries are equipped with safety release valves, designed to operate between 2 and 5 psi and automatically reseal. Hence, there is never an exces- sive accumulation of gas within the battery. Heavy Duty Grids ......................... Heavy duty lead calcium tin alloy grids provide an extra margin of performance and service life in either float or cyclic applications, even after repeated over discharges. Cyclic Service Life ........................ More that 1000 discharge/recharge cycles can be realized from Yuasa NP bat- teries, dependent on the average depth of discharge. Float Service Life .......................... NP Series batteries have an expected life span of 3 to 5 years in float service applications. Self Discharge - Shelf Life ............. The self discharge rate of the NP series at room temperature is approximately 3% of rated capacity per month. Operating Temperature ................. Yuasa NP Batteries may be operated over a broad range of ambient temperatures. Deep Discharge Recovery ............. NP batteries recover their capacities even after repeated deep discharges. 1 Rev.- 5/00 APPLICATIONS A partial list of common applications include: FLOAT SERVICE CYCLIC SERVICE FLOAT/CYCLIC SERVICE Burglar and Fire Alarm Audio & Video Equipment Medical Equipment Office Machines Portable Lights Communications Cash Registers Electric Wheelchairs Cellular Telephones Solar Power Devices Test Equipment Telecommunications Geophysical Equipment U.P.S.Equipment Emergency Lighting Computers YUASANP BATTERY CONSTRUCTION Terminal Relief Valve Top Cover Sealant Cover Negative Plate Container Electrolyte Retentive Separator Positive Plate SEALED LEAD BATTERY MUST BE RECYCLED OR DISPOSED OF PROPERLY Rev.- 5/00 2 GENERAL SPECIFICATIONS NP SERIES NPH SERIES Nominal Overall Height Type FR Type* Volts Capacity Length Width Incl.Terminals Weight Layout Terminals (10 hr rate - Ah) mm.

During the life of NP batteries, there is no need to check their specific gravity or add water etc. In fact, there are no provisions for such maintenance functions to be carried out. Operation In Any Orientation . . . . . . The combination of sealed construction and Yuasa s electrolyte suspension system permits operation of NP batteries in any orientation (excluding continuous inverted use) without loss of capacity, electrolyte, or service life. The NP batteries made in our factory in Wales also conform to BS EN61056-1 (1993) and IEC 1056- 1 (1991). Low Pressure Venting System . . . . . Yuasa NP batteries are equipped with a safe, low pressure venting system, which is designed to release excess gas and reseal automatically in the event of the internal gas pressure rising to an unacceptable level. This low pressure venting system, coupled with the significantly high recombination efficiency, make Yuasa NP batteries one of the safest valve regulated lead acid batteries available. Heavy Duty Grids . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . The heavy duty lead calcium alloy grids in NP batteries provide an extra margin of performance and service life in both float and cyclic applications, even in conditions of deep discharge. Cyclic Service Life . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Depending upon the average depth of discharge, over 1,000 discharge/ recharge cycles can be expected from NP batteries. Float Service Life . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . The expected service life of the standard model NP battery when used in stand- by applications is typically 5 years; however, experience has shown that their service life often exceeds 6 years, if the NP batteries are operated strictly within specification. 1 Low Self Discharge -Long Shelf Life . At temperatures of between 20 & 25 c, the self discharge rate of NP batteries per month is approximately 3% of their rated capacity. This low self discharge rate permits storage for up to one year without any appreciable deterioration of battery performance. Operating Temperature Range ........... Yuasa NP batteries can be used over a broad range of ambient temperatures, allowing considerable flexibility in system design and location. High Recovery Capability .................... Yuasa NP batteries have excellent charge acceptance and recovery capability, even after very deep discharge. Quality Assurance ................................ Our U.K. manufacturing plant now has Quality Assurance Standard BS5750 Part 2 EN2900, ISO 9002 together with the M.O.D. Quality Assurance AQAP 4.

The combination of sealed construction and Yuasa s electrolyte suspension system permits operation of NP batteries in any orientation (excluding continuous inverted use) without loss of capacity, electrolyte, or service life. The NP batteries made in our factory in Wales also conform to BS EN61056-1 (1993) and IEC 1056- 1 (1991). Low Pressure Venting System . . . . . Yuasa NP batteries are equipped with a safe, low pressure venting system, which is designed to release excess gas and reseal automatically in the event of the internal gas pressure rising to an unacceptable level. This low pressure venting system, coupled with the significantly high recombination efficiency, make Yuasa NP batteries one of the safest valve regulated lead acid batteries available. Heavy Duty Grids . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . The heavy duty lead calcium alloy grids in NP batteries provide an extra margin of performance and service life in both float and cyclic applications, even in conditions of deep discharge. Cyclic Service Life . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Depending upon the average depth of discharge, over 1,000 discharge/ recharge cycles can be expected from NP batteries. Float Service Life . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . The expected service life of the standard model NP battery when used in stand- by applications is typically 5 years; however, experience has shown that their service life often exceeds 6 years, if the NP batteries are operated strictly within specification. 1 Low Self Discharge -Long Shelf Life . At temperatures of between 20 & 25 c, the self discharge rate of NP batteries per month is approximately 3% of their rated capacity. This low self discharge rate permits storage for up to one year without any appreciable deterioration of battery performance. Operating Temperature Range ........... Yuasa NP batteries can be used over a broad range of ambient temperatures, allowing considerable flexibility in system design and location. High Recovery Capability .................... Yuasa NP batteries have excellent charge acceptance and recovery capability, even after very deep discharge. Quality Assurance ................................

They are critical to the efficient operation of every modern building and form an essential part of a life safety strategy. By virtue of their design, elevator shafts are a critical component of building infrastructure. Like chimneys, they allow air and smoke to be transported rapidly across multiple floors, accelerated by the elevator movement inside. For these reasons, the elevator shaft is a critical consideration for fire protection and an evacuation strategy.

NPLOffers up to double the float service life of the conven- tional NP type battery. Note, these models are available to NPCis specifically designed to suit the arduous require- BS6290pt4 (1997). ments of cyclic applications allowing increased cycle life (at least double the cyclic life of conventional types). The generic types utilise identical physical designs and characteristics to the standard NP type in all aspects except NPH These high performance batteries are specifically their specific application advancement. This in many cases designed for applications requiring high rate discharge and allows users to upgrade without major redesign. offer much improved power densities up to 50% more TECHNICAL FEATURES Sealed Construction . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Yuasa s unique construction and sealing technique ensures that no electrolyte leakage should occur from the terminals or case of any NP battery. This feature provides for safe and effective operation of NP batteries in any orientation. Yuasa NP batteries are classified as Non-Spillable and meet all requirements of the International Air Transport Association. (I.A.T.A. Dangerous Goods Regulations), to allow transportation by air. Electrolyte Suspension System All Yuasa NP batteries utilise an electrolyte suspension system consisting of a glass fibre separator material. This suspension system helps to achieve maximum service life, by fully retaining the electrolyte and preventing its escape from the separator material. No silica gels or other contaminents are used. Gas Generation . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . NP batteries incorporate a unique Yuasa design that effectively recombines over 99% of the gas generated during normal usage. LowMaintenance Operation . . . . . . . During the life of NP batteries, there is no need to check their specific gravity or add water etc. In fact, there are no provisions for such maintenance functions to be carried out.
